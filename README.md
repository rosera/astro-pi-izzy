NASA Astro Pi - Code Club

Introduction
The European Astro Pi Challenge is an ESA Education project run in collaboration with the Raspberry Pi Foundation. Astro Pi Mission Space Lab offers young people the amazing opportunity to conduct scientific investigations in space by writing computer programs that run on Raspberry Pi computers — the Astro Pis — aboard the International Space Station.

For our experiment we will use Izzy, the astro pi computer on the outside of the ISS. 

We plan to take a picture every 15 mins and identify where the ISS is in relation to the Earth. We will also take various atmosphere related readings using the Sense Hat during this time. 

#Code sample here with explanation
