Introduction
The European Astro Pi Challenge is an ESA Education project run in collaboration with the Raspberry Pi Foundation. Astro Pi Mission Space Lab offers young people the amazing opportunity to conduct scientific investigations in space by writing computer programs that run on Raspberry Pi computers — the Astro Pis — aboard the International Space Station.

For our experiment we will use Izzy, the astro pi computer on the outside of the ISS. 

We plan to take a picture every 5 mins and identify where the ISS is in relation to the Earth using geocoordinates. We will also take various atmosphere related readings using a Sense Hat during this time. 

# Code sample here with explanation


Features
--------
Based on the information gathered 

- Izzy will compare this with location weather information taken from earth and see if there is any difference
- See if there are any patterns from the sensor information
- See if we can make any predictions based on the information we have for weather in that area
- Saves co-ordinates to a series of CSV files
- Save images to a series of jpg files
- The program runs for 3 hrs then stops

Installation/Activation
